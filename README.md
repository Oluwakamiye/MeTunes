# MeTunes

## About
MeTunes is an iOS app based on Apple music's free version of the API. It is written entirely in Swift and has a minimum deployment version of iOS 14. MeTunes allows you to search for free 30 second clips of a song and allows you play them within the app.

## Architecture
MeTunes is developed using the MVVM-C architecture for separation of concerns. Navigation is handled by the Coordinator class for a more modular approach.

## Libraries and Frameworks
MeTunes uses UIKit to develop the views and Combine is used to synchronise data across the app
